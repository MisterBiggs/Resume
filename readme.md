# Personal Resume

This repository contains my personal which was originally based off of a template found on <a href="html5up.net">HTML5 UP</a>. I plan on updating this website as my resume grows. The main reason that this is on GitLab is so that I can practice useing git version control, but if you have any comments, or would like to add anything to the site feel free to put in a PR or contact me.
The website is live at http://ansonbiggs.com and hosted on a https://www.digitalocean.com/ droplet.

The test.html is there just for examples of what is possible in the future and are left over from the original template.
