    <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
    <p>
      I am an undergraduate Aerospace Engineering student focusing on
      Astronautics and a minor in Computer Science studying at Embry-Riddle
      Aeronautical University in Prescott, Arizona. I have successfully led
      teams ranging from fast-paced kitchen environments, construction of 11,000
      square foot restaurants to 40 student engineering teams. I have a massive
      portfolio of code in dozens of languages over a decade; many of my
      projects are used by thousands of people a month.

    <h2>EXPERIENCE</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>
        Orbital Debris Classification, Undergrad Research, Fall 2021-Spring 2022
      </dt>
      <dd>
        University research project working directly with the Dean of
        Engineering, using machine learning and high-resolution 3D scans of
        shrapnel from high-velocity impacts to help classify Orbital Debris.
        Current Orbital Debris evasion uses only a rough volume of Orbital
        Debris to determine if an evasive maneuver is required for mission
        safety. We hope to allow better classification to enable more informed
        decisions increasing safety and reducing the cost of space missions.

        2018-Current
      </dt>
      <dd>
        A project I started in Python that aims to provide a social and
        straightforward interface to the stock market on various chat platforms
        that allow bots. The project has grown into having thousands of monthly
        active users sending the bot over 1 million commands a month.

          >Redline Racing Division</a
        >, Secretary / Business Lead 2018-2021
      </dt>
      <dd>
        A University club for a student design competition where the goal is to
        build a formula-style race car almost entirely from scratch. Helped
        develop plans to aid in team collaboration, build relationships with
        local companies, and helped with team configuration management. During
        my time, the team grew from 8 to about 40 active students.

      <dt>
        <a href="https://hubgrill.com/">The Hub</a>, Team Leader 2012-2021
      </dt>
      <dd>
        I assisted in growing the company from 1 to 3 successful locations.
        Roles ranged from entire building remodels to designing menus and other
        documentation to training full kitchen and serving staff teams. During
        my undergrad, I have continued with the company in a fast-paced team
        leadership position during my summers off from college.

    <h2>AWARDS AND ACHIEVEMENTS</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Top 50 | Tegra K1 CUDA Vision Challenge, NVIDIA 2015</dt>
      <dd>
        Competition which involved building a computer vision platform using a
        small development board with an integrated GPU from NVIDIA. My project
        involved implementing cameras in restaurants to ensure food was prepared
        properly before being delivered to guests.
      </dd>
      <dt>Discord Verified Bot Developer</dt>
      <dd>
        Discord bots and applications that are active in more than 100 servers
        can only be managed by a developer that has been verified by Discord.
        Several of my projects have passed this threshold.
