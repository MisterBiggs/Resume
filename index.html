    <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
    <p>
      I am an undergraduate Aerospace Engineering student with a focus on
      Astronautics and a minor in Computer Science studying at Embry-Riddle
      Aeronautical University in Prescott, Arizona. I have successfully led
      teams ranging from fast paced kitchen enviroments, construction of 11,000
      square foot restaurants, to 40 student engineering teams. I also have a
      massive portfolio of code in dozens of languages over the course of almost
      a decade, many of my projects are used by thousands of people a month.

    <h3>
      Simple Stock Bots,
      <a href="https://simplestockbot.com">simplestockbot.com</a> 2018-Current
    </h3>
    <p>
      Python project that aims to provide a simple interface to the stock market
      on various platforms that allow bots. Thousands of monthly active users.
      Changes to its Gitlab Repository automatically update live code running in
      a Kubernetes cluster I manage.

    <h2>AWARDS AND ACHIEVEMENTS</h2>
    <h3>Top 50 | Tegra K1 CUDA Vision Challenge, NVIDIA 2015</h3>
    <p>
      A competition which involved building a computer vision platform using a
      small dev board from NVIDIA which had a built-in GPU. My project involved
      implementing cameras in kitchens to ensure food was prepared properly
      before being delivered to guests.
    </p>
    <h3>Discord Verified Bot Developer</h3>
    <p>
      Discord bots and applications that are active in more than 100 servers can
      only be managed by a developer that has been verified by Discord. Several
      of my projects have passed this threshold.
