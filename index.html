    <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
    <p>
      I am an undergraduate Aerospace Engineering student with a focus on
      Astronautics and a minor in Computer Science studying at Embry-Riddle
      Aeronautical University in Prescott, Arizona. I have successfully led
      teams ranging from fast paced kitchen enviroments, construction of 11,000
      square foot restaurants, to 40 student engineering teams. I also have a
      massive portfolio of code in dozens of languages over the course of almost
      a decade, many of my projects are used by thousands of people a month.
    </p>
    <h2>EXPERIENCE</h2>
    <h3><a href="https://hubgrill.com/">The Hub</a>, Team Leader 2012-2021</h3>
    <p>
      Assisted growing company from 1 to 3 successful locations. Roles ranged
      from full building remodels to designing menus and other documentation to
      training full teams of kitchen and serving staff. I have continued with
      the company during my undergrad in a fast paced team leadership position
      during my summers off from college.

    </h3>
    <p>
      Python project that aims to provide a simple interface and social to the
      stock market on various platforms that allow bots. Thousands of monthly
      active users. Changes to its Gitlab Repository automatically update live
      code running in a Kubernetes cluster I manage.

    <h2>AWARDS AND ACHIEVEMENTS</h2>
    <h3>Top 50 | Tegra K1 CUDA Vision Challenge, NVIDIA 2015</h3>
    <p>
      Competition which involved building a computer vision platform using a
      small dev board with an integrated GPU from NVIDIA. My project involved
      implementing cameras in restaurants to ensure food was prepared properly
      before being delivered to guests.
    </p>
    <h3>Discord Verified Bot Developer</h3>
    <p>
      Discord bots and applications that are active in more than 100 servers can
      only be managed by a developer that has been verified by Discord. Several
      of my projects have passed this threshold.
