    <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
    <p>
      I am an undergraduate Aerospace Engineering student with a focus on
      Astronautics and a minor in Computer Science studying at Embry-Riddle
      Aeronautical University in Prescott, Arizona. I have successfully led
      teams ranging from fast paced kitchen enviroments, construction of 11,000
      square foot restaurants, to 40 student engineering teams. I also have a
      massive portfolio of code in dozens of languages over the course of almost
      a decade, many of my projects are used by thousands of people a month.

        Assisted growing company from 1 to 3 successful locations. Roles ranged
        from full building remodels to designing menus and other documentation
        to training full teams of kitchen and serving staff. I have continued
        with the company during my undergrad in a fast paced team leadership
        position during my summers off from college.

      <dd>
        Student design competition where the goal is to build a formula-style
        race car. Helped develop plans to aid in team collaboration, build
        relationships with local companies, and helped with team configuration
        management. During my time the team grew from 8 to about 40 active
        students.

    <h2>AWARDS AND ACHIEVEMENTS</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Top 50 | Tegra K1 CUDA Vision Challenge, NVIDIA 2015</dt>
      <dd>
        Competition which involved building a computer vision platform using a
        small dev board with an integrated GPU from NVIDIA. My project involved
        implementing cameras in restaurants to ensure food was prepared properly
        before being delivered to guests.
      </dd>
      <dt>Discord Verified Bot Developer</dt>
      <dd>
        Discord bots and applications that are active in more than 100 servers
        can only be managed by a developer that has been verified by Discord.
        Several of my projects have passed this threshold.
